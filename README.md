Newspeace is a news aggregator focused on human rights and humanitarian crises. The application analyzes each piece of news, providing a list of non-governmental institutions that are responsible for the detected topic (e.g.: aid to refugees). The project was implemented with the Ionic and CapacitorJS frameworks, which allow the application to be compatible with several mobile operating systems, such as iOS and Android, from a single code. To mitigate the inclusion of false information, reliable data sources were used to obtain data on organizations, news and locations.

The application relates to Sustainable Development Goal 16, whose proposal is to “promote resilient and inclusive societies for sustainable development, provide access to justice for all and build effective, accountable and inclusive institutions at all levels”.
